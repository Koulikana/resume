    content: `After a first degree in accounting and management, then a year and a half work experience in finance, in late 2018 I decided to do a professional retraining. I did my professional retraining in software development by following a programme made by the EPSI. This programme lasted 15 months and included 12 months part-time job with the French online merchant Cdiscount.
    Within these 12 months at Cdiscount, I mostly acquired skills in back-end development using the Microsoft .NET environment. Besides, I managed data bases in SQL and developed some front-end components with ReactJS.
    I currently looking for a back-end job opportunity in Bordeaux, France. However, I’m expecting to be a full stack developer, as so I would like to practice more front-end developments with ReactJS.
