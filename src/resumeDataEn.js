    content: `After a first degree in accounting and management, then a year and a half work experience in finance, I decided in late 2018 to do a career change. I did a professional retraining in software development by following a programme made by the EPSI. This programme lasted 15 months and included 12 months part-time job in the French online merchant Cdiscount.
    I mostly acquired skills in back-end development using the Microsoft .NET environment. Besides, I managed data bases in SQL and developed some front-end components with ReactJS.
    I currently looking for a back-end job opportunity in Bordeaux, France. Furthermore, I’m really interested in becoming a full stack developer, in order to practice more front-end developments with ReactJS.
